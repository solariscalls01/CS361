#TODO 1
# If a user selects the beginner option (e.g., "1"), UI app should write to a text file indicating "1".
# write a program that is able to read the text file command and interpret the results and create the quiz according
# to the selection the user has made. Create separate microsrvices for beginner, intermediate, advanced





#TODO 2
# create a general if/ then quiz program. The microsrvice quiz runs on its own, and does not send information back to the UI until
# the quiz is completed. It should display the question, followed by the multiple choice questions. After all the questions are asked,
# it tallys the total scores if the user guesses correctly and displays the total correct score. Send the information back to the UI displaying the score
# from the UI
